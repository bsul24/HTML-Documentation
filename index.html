        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements,
          which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning
          in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of
          a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a
          header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed
          content such as images and videos into a page. This module will
          introduce the first two of these and introduce fundamental concepts
          and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="prereq">
        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>
          Before starting this module, you don't need any previous HTML
          knowledge, but you should have at least basic familiarity with using
          computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it and
          consuming content). You should have a basic work environment set up,
          and understand how to create and manage files.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="what-is">
        <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        <p>
          HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. It is
          a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web
          pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web
          developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which
          you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to
          make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make
          content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words,
          and so on. For example, consider the following line of text:
        </p>
        <code class="block"> My cat is very grumpy </code>
        <p>
          If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is
          a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph (&lt;p>) element:
        </p>
        <code class="block">
          &lt;<span class="element">p</span>>My cat is very grumpy&lt;<span
            class="element"
            >p</span
          >>
        </code>
      </section>
      <section id="anatomy-element">
        <h2>Anatomy of an HTML element</h2>
        <p>
          Let's further explore our paragraph element from the previous section.
        </p>
        <p>The anatomy of our element is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the
            element (in this example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and
            closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element
            begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the
            start of the paragraph text.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element. In
            this example, it is the paragraph text.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The closing tag:</strong>This is the same as the opening
            tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element
            name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a
            closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar
            results.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the
          closing tag.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="active-learning">
        <h2>Active learning</h2>
        <p>
          Open a text editor on your computer and wrap the sentence "This is my
          text." with the tags &lt;em> and &lt;/em>. To
          <i>open the element</i>, put the opening tag &lt;em> at the start of
          the line. To <i>close the element</i>, put the closing tag &lt;/em> at
          the end of the line. Save the file with the extension .html and try to
          open it in a browser. Doing this should give the line italic text
          formatting!
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="nesting">
        <h2>Nesting elements</h2>
        <p>
          Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called
          <i>nesting</i>. If we wanted to state that our cat is
          <strong>very</strong> grumpy, we could wrap the word <i>very</i> in a
          &lt;strong> element, which means that the word is to have strong(er)
          text formatting:
        </p>
        <code class="block">
          &lt;<span class="element">p</span>>My cat is &lt;<span class="element"
            >strong</span
          >>very&lt;/<span class="element">strong</span>> grumpy.&lt;/<span
            class="element"
            >p</span
          >>
        </code>
        <p>
          There is a right and wrong way to do nesting. In the example above, we
          opened the <code>p</code> element first, then opened the
          <code>strong</code> element. For proper nesting, we should close the
          <code>strong</code> element first, before closing the <code>p</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following is an example of the <i>wrong</i> way to do nesting:
        </p>
        <code class="block">
          &lt;<span class="element">p</span>>My cat is &lt;<span class="element"
            >strong</span
          >>very grumpy.&lt;/<span class="element">p</span>>&lt;/<span
            class="element"
            >strong</span
          >>
        </code>
        <p>
          The
          <strong
            >tags have to open and close in a way that they are inside or
            outside one another</strong
          >. With the kind of overlap in the example above, the browser has to
          guess at your intent. This kind of guessing can result in unexpected
          results.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="attributes">
        <h2>Attributes</h2>
        <p>Elements can also have attributes. Attributes look like this:</p>
        <img
          src="./images/attributeImage.png"
          alt="Display of using a class inside of an element tag"
        />
        <p>
          Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't
          appear in the content. In this example, the class attribute is an
          identifying name used to target the element with style information.
        </p>
        <p>An attribute should have:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more
            than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces
            too.)
          </li>
          <li>The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.</li>
          <li>
            An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="anatomy-document">
        <h2>Anatomy of an HTML document</h2>
        <p>
          Individual HTML elements aren't very useful on their own. Next, let's
          examine how individual elements combine to form an entire HTML page:
        </p>
        <code class="block">
          &lt;<span class="doc">!DOCTYPE html</span>>
          <br />
          &lt;<span class="element">html</span>>
          <br />
          &ensp;&lt;<span class="element">head</span>>
          <br />
          &ensp;&ensp;&lt;<span class="element">meta</span>
          <span class="attribute">charset</span>="<span class="value"
            >utf-8</span
          >">
          <br />
          &ensp;&ensp;&lt;<span class="element">title</span>>My test
          page&lt;/<span class="element">title</span>>
          <br />
          &ensp;&lt;/<span class="element">head</span>>
          <br />
          &ensp;&lt;<span class="element">body</span>>
          <br />
          &ensp;&ensp;&lt;<span class="element">p</span>>This is my
          page&lt;/<span class="element">p</span>>
          <br />
          &ensp;&lt;/<span class="element">body</span>>
          <br />
          &lt;/<span class="element">html</span>>
        </code>
        <p>Here we have:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html></code>: The doctype. When HTML was young
              (1991-1992), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules
              that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML.
              Doctypes used to look something like this:
            </p>
            <code class="block">
              &lt;<span class="doc">!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC</span>
              <span class="attribute"
                >"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
                "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"</span
              >>
            </code>
            More recently, the doctype is a historical artifact that needs to be
            included for everything else to work right.
            <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html></code> is the shortest string of characters
            that counts as a valid doctype. That is all you need to know!
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>&lt;html>&lt;/html></code>: The
            <code>&lt;html></code> element. This element wraps all the content
            on the page. It is sometimes known as the root element.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>&lt;head>&lt;/head></code>: The
            <code>&lt;head></code> element. This element acts as a container for
            everything you want to include on the HTML page,
            <b>that isn't the content</b> the page will show to viewers. This
            includes keywords and a page description that would appear in search
            results, CSS to style content, character set declarations, and more.
            You will learn more about this in the next article of the series.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"></code>: The
            <code>&lt;meta></code> element. This element represents metadata
            that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like
            <code>&lt;base></code>, <code>&lt;link></code>,
            <code>&lt;script></code>, <code>&lt;style></code> or
            <code>&lt;title></code>. The <code>charset</code> attributes sets
            the character set for your document to UTF-8, which includes most
            characters from the vast majority of human written languages. With
            this setting, the page can now handle any textual content it might
            contain. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid
            some problems later.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>&lt;title>&lt;/title></code>: The
            <code>&lt;title></code> element. This sets the title of the page,
            which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is
            loaded in. The page title is also used to describe the page when it
            is bookmarked.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>&lt;body>&lt;/body></code>: The
            <code>&lt;body></code> element. This contains all the content that
            displays on the page, including text, images, videos, games,
            playable audio tracks, or whatever else.
